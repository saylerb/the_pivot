### What are your learning goals for this project?
*B: get a review of basic rails and then go deeper; practice; practice styling; communication
*C: Improve and strengthen rails knowledge
*E: Routing , styling
*All: work on mulitenency; work on the planning together
*use bootstrap for styling; look in into sass
### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
*like pairing on the more rigorous problems; divide and conquer on things we know how to do; pair also when we get stuck
*have daily stand ups; schedule to be set day to day; nightly recap
*keep communicating even after we all split up; before we split up on our own, be clear on what people are working on; give updates when we are working on our own
*nightly updates at the end of the day
### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
*in person if here, on slack
*specific, actionable, kind
*communication in the moment
*texting for urgent things
*communicate clearly about our schedule before hand to avoid pushing or important conversations without one person
*let’s be diligent about code review comments in git hub ; specifically code related conversations should be held on github, not slack
### How would you describe your work style?
*E: like to know the plan and work the plan; like to have timeframes; detail oriented, sometimes wants to plan too much rather than diving in
*C: tends to crash after 7-8pm; wants to solve problem on own; wants to have a map of the app and what leads where; wire framing and mapping out the site; outline form
*B: wants to work more in the mornings; wants to go to bed early and come in early; could go off and work on things and not tell anyone, just remind me; trying to make sure I get help instead of just going off on my own; wants to solve problems no matter what it takes; practice asking for help and getting another set of eyes
### What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
*pairing and collaborating was helpful; need to find balance between getting strategic help and making progress on your own
*we should take meetings times and schedules seriously; make realistic times that people can hit
*team being in same space even if we’re not all pairing or working on the same thing
*strong personalities clashing; agree to trend towards a simpler implementation; follow red/green/refactor -> defer to not optimizing things that we don’t know we need to/ over-designing; be strategic about when we refactor vs just making the tests pass
*if large disagreement, each can check out a branch and work on it

### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
*Chris: appointment both wednesdays ; leaving before 5; group will meet up discuss plan after wrap up
*stay after wrap up together until 6pm; do a hard focused push right after wrap up
*Next week SQL hw on thursday
*sunday afternoon BBQ; lighter day
*people working at the same time in the morning on the weekends; come in late morning
### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
*group aversion to giving people critical feedback
*trying to speak up as close to the event as possible; don’t let things fester; user re-DTR to give feedback
*can give written feedback as well when things come up
### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
*C: decent at rails, wants to work on styling; solid on routing; layout has been daunting
*B: don’t feel super strong on any one part of rails; feels good on CRUD and db design; biggest weakness is pushing stuff down the stack; not as comfortable with fancier rails stuff; wants to have group conversation about those things; strong in authentication, not comfortable with authorization, would like to work on this with someone; would like to play with JS; not super comfortable with styling
*E: styling, nested routes, namespacing as it pertains to authorization needs to work; generally solid on rails; will be the PM; can take the lead on some of the organization and keeping people on track; can help remind people about pomodoros
*Styling: little pieces that each person can work on; minimal styling
### What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
*Waffle!! slack
*utilize github and waffle integration

### Git workflow?
*be consistent about naming
*if you’ve pushed up, don’t rebase
*development branch that we treat like master; keep dev branch clean as possible
*branches are free
*as much parallel between waffle and git branches
*practice frequent, small, logical commits
